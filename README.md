**InkSlab** is a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W project that displays your TCG card collection on a 7-color e-ink screen, rotating through cards on a configurable schedule. A full web dashboard lets you browse your collection, manage downloads, and control the display from any device on your network — no app required.

Supports **Pokémon**, **Magic: The Gathering**, **Disney Lorcana**, **Manga covers**, **Comics covers**, and **custom images**.

> **Forked from** [costamesatechsolutions/inkslab-eink-tcg-display](https://github.com/costamesatechsolutions/inkslab-eink-tcg-display) — significantly extended with a full UI redesign, mobile support, security hardening, and new features.

## Features

### Web Dashboard
- Responsive layout: desktop sidebar + mobile bottom tab bar
- Display tab with live card preview, Up Next queue (5 cards), and Previous cards panel
- Collection tab with grid and list views, thumbnails, and hover/tap preview
- Downloads tab with per-source pill selector and progress log
- Settings tab with display config, auto-update, PIN protection, and WiFi management

### Display
- 7-color e-ink (Spectra 6: black, white, green, blue, red, yellow, orange)
- Slab header with set name, year, card number, and rarity — three modes: Normal, Inverted, Off
- Full-bleed overlay headers for manga/comics
- Color saturation boost and dithering (Floyd-Steinberg)
- Smart shuffle — recently shown cards pushed to back of queue
- Day/night intervals with configurable hours

### Collection Management
- **All Cards / Owned Only** — segmented control; Owned Only shows only cards you've marked as owned in the collection
- Grid view with thumbnails; List view with hover preview and mobile accordion
- Quick Switch Collection — change active TCG instantly with a pending-queue notification on other clients
- Search by card name and add all printings at once
- Rarity-tier select/deselect
- Per-series delete with two-step confirmation
- Favorites list per TCG

### Downloads
- Unified pill selector — one interface for all sources
- Per-set search and download for all TCGs
- Pokémon bulk download by name (e.g., search "Charizard" → download all prints)
- MTG set search via Scryfall API
- Manga series search via MangaDex (no account required)
- Comics series search via Metron API (free account required)
- Download status log with timestamps and color-coded output (blue = Done, red = failures)
- Storage breakdown by library + free space gauge

### Settings
- Display interval, rotation, saturation, image fit and background
- Auto-update scheduler (weekly, per source, configurable day)
- Metron Comics account (credentials encrypted with device-specific key)
- PIN protection — 4–8 digit PIN, PBKDF2-SHA256, rate-limited login
- Admin mode — PIN re-authentication gate, 60-second auto-close, tab-switch reset
- OTA updates — check and install from GitHub directly from the dashboard
- WiFi setup and management
- System info panel (CPU temperature, RAM, uptime, IP address)
- Factory reset for clean handoff for a new owner

### Custom Images
- Upload PNG or JPG files organized into named folders
- Editable card name, number, rarity, and set metadata
- Treated as a first-class collection alongside TCGs

### Infrastructure
- Automated installer (`install.sh`)
- Self-healing on boot (`selfheal.sh`) — verifies files, resets from git on corruption
- OTA update with rollback safety (`ota_update.sh`)
- Hardware watchdog and journal size cap
- Atomic JSON writes (temp file + `os.rename`) throughout
- Non-blocking thumbnail generation (background thread)
- Captive portal for WiFi setup on first boot

## Hardware

| Part | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** | Required. Pi Zero W H also works but is noticeably slower |
| **Waveshare 4" e-Paper HAT+ (E) — Spectra 6** | 400×600, 7-color. Must be this exact model |
| **MicroSD card** | 8 GB minimum. 32–64 GB recommended for full TCG libraries |
| **5V micro USB power supply** | Standard Pi power supply |
| **90-degree micro USB cable** | Optional but recommended — hides the cable behind the frame |
| **3D printed frame** | [InkSlab on MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2452200-inkslab-open-source-e-ink-tcg-display) |

**Storage estimates by library:**
- Pokémon: ~15–25 GB (all sets)
- MTG: ~60–80 GB (all sets)
- Lorcana: ~2–4 GB
- Manga / Comics: varies by series

## Setup — Pre-Flashed Units

If you received a pre-configured InkSlab unit:

1. Power it on — the display shows an **InkSlab Setup** screen with a QR code and network name
2. Connect your phone or laptop to the **InkSlab-Setup** WiFi network
3. A setup page will open automatically (or navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`)
4. Enter your home WiFi credentials and tap **Connect**
5. The screen updates with your InkSlab's IP address and a QR code — scan it or navigate to that IP from any browser on your network
6. Open the dashboard and start downloading card sets from the **Downloads** tab

---

## Setup — DIY Flash

### 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS

Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** to your SD card. In the imager's advanced settings, configure your hostname, SSH, and optionally your WiFi credentials.

### 2. Enable SPI

SSH into your Pi and run:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Navigate to **Interface Options → SPI → Enable**. The install script will also check and enable SPI automatically.

### 3. Run the Installer

```bash
cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/GenerlAce/inkslab-eink-tcg-display.git inkslab
cd inkslab
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
sudo bash scripts/install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Check and enable SPI (prompts reboot if needed)
- Install all system and Python dependencies
- Install and start both systemd services
- Verify the services are running

### 4. Install Dependencies Manually (if needed)

```bash
# System packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-pil python3-numpy python3-spidev \
  python3-gpiozero python3-requests python3-flask python3-qrcode \
  git gpiod libgpiod-dev

# Python packages
pip3 install waitress --break-system-packages
pip3 install cryptography --break-system-packages
```

### 5. First Boot

Power on the Pi with the display attached. Within 30–60 seconds:
- The display shows the InkSlab setup screen with the local IP address
- Open `http://<your-pi-ip>` in a browser
- If no cards are downloaded yet, the display shows a placeholder

The Waveshare driver is bundled in `lib/waveshare_epd/` — no additional library installation is needed.

## Starting and Managing Services

```bash
# Start
sudo systemctl start inkslab inkslab_web

# Stop
sudo systemctl stop inkslab inkslab_web

# Restart
sudo systemctl restart inkslab inkslab_web

# Enable on boot
sudo systemctl enable inkslab inkslab_web

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u inkslab -f
sudo journalctl -u inkslab_web -f
```

### selfheal.sh

`selfheal.sh` runs automatically before the display daemon starts (via `ExecStartPre=` in the service file). It:
- Syntax-checks all Python files
- Resets corrupted files from git if needed (with rollback on failure)
- Removes stale lock/temp files from crashed sessions
- Enables the hardware watchdog (auto-reboots if the daemon hangs for 10+ minutes)
- Caps the systemd journal at 50 MB to protect the SD card

## Updating

### From the Dashboard

Go to **Settings → OTA Updates → Check for Updates**. If an update is available, click **Install**. The update runs in the background with rollback safety — if the new version fails to start, the previous version is automatically restored.

### Via SSH

```bash
cd /home/pi/inkslab
git pull
sudo systemctl restart inkslab inkslab_web
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Display shows nothing after boot | Wait 60–90 seconds — first render is slow. Check `sudo journalctl -u inkslab -n 50` |
| "No cards available" on screen | No card images downloaded yet. Go to Downloads tab and download a set |
| Owned Only mode shows no cards | Switch to **All Cards**, browse a set, and mark cards as owned first |
| Queue switch not firing immediately | The switch fires at the next card interval, not instantly |
| Admin mode requires PIN entry | Enter your dashboard PIN to access admin features — resets on page refresh |
| Collection list thumbnails missing | Thumbnails generate from downloaded images. Download content first, then enable thumbnail cache in Settings |
| Cooldown timer won't let me skip | The Waveshare Spectra 6 requires 3 minutes between full refreshes to prevent display damage. Queue the skip or wait |
| Downloads fail with permission error | The download scripts run as root via systemd. Check that `/home/pi/inkslab-collections/` is writable by root |
| Comics search returns no results | Metron API credentials required. Set them in Settings → Metron Comics Account |
| WiFi setup page doesn't appear | Connect to the **InkSlab-Setup** network, then navigate to `http://192.168.4.1` manually |
| Display colors look washed out | Increase **Color Saturation** in Settings (default 2.5, try 3.0–3.5) |
| Service fails to start | Run `sudo bash /home/pi/inkslab/scripts/selfheal.sh` manually to check and repair |
| OTA update failed | The previous version is automatically restored. Check `sudo journalctl -u inkslab_web -n 50` |
